# Unsolved-Murder-Data
Visualizing the Washington Post's Original Data


This is taking the data from this Washington Post Article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/unsolved-homicide-database/.

This is the original repo: https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides

My goal for this project was to make a dashboard that made it a lot easier to spot geographical trends in the data if there were any. Check it out!
